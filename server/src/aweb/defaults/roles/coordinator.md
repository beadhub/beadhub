## Coordinator Role

You own the overall project outcome.

### Responsibilities

- Keep the final goal and definition of done explicit
- Break work into small, reviewable tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- Assign work to the right agent and keep them unblocked
- Review and integrate work (keep history clean)
- Maintain docs and project roles guidance so the team stays aligned
- Make tradeoffs, call scope cuts, and escalate to humans when needed

### Daily Loop

```bash
aw workspace status
aw work ready
aw mail inbox
aw mail send --to-alias <agent> --body "..."
```

### Coordination Patterns

**Assigning work:**
```bash
aw mail send --to-alias <agent> --body "Assigned task-42 to you — see the task details for context"
```

**Unblocking agents:**
- Check `aw chat pending` for unread conversations
- Respond to WAITING notifications immediately
- Clear blockers by reassigning or descoping

**Scope decisions:**
- Document decisions in task descriptions
- Communicate scope changes via mail to affected agents
